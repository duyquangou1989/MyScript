#### HAPROXY MYSQL 
I have seen two causes for this error in your setup.

Please comment out the "bind-address" statment in your my.cnf configs for your mariadb servers and restart them (one at a time, wait for them to rejoin the cluster)

In HAproxy, you need to use a special options to allow haproxy to mark the server as up. A standard tcpchk will not work for an extended period of time for a number of reasons.

a. Create an "haproxy" user in your database, no password. You can lock down its permissions later.

b. Add "option mysql-check user haproxy" to your haproxy.cfg under your Maria/Galera section

c. Restart Haproxy

That should solve your issue. A quick telnet to your virtual ip address should show you that it is working.
